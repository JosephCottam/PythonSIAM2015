    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Several installers are provided for Win-64, Win-32, OSX-64, Ubuntu-64,\n",
    "and Ubuntu-32. For other flavors of Linux, typically you can acquire\n",

    "\n",
    "Open the installer and go through the default installation to install \n",

    "-----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Start VirtualBox, and in the main menu, go to \"File->Import Appliance\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the \"pyvis.ova\" that is provided on this USB drive. Continue\n",
    "through the default options for the virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will unpack and install the virtual machine on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Three: Launch the Virtual Machine\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In VirtualBox, in the virtual machine lists, open the new \"pyvis\" virtual \n",
    "machine.  This will start Arch Linux in a virtual machine on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will automatically launch into an graphical session with two open\n",
    "terminals and a ipython notebook session.\n",

    "password of \"pyvis\". It has sudo access, and the root password is \"pyvis\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Step Four: Copy the tutorial materials\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you are connected to the internet, run \"get-internet\"\n",
    "from the terminal, which should be open in one of the windows.\n",
    "\n",

    "$ get-internet\n",
    "```\n",

    "## In the case you are not connected to the internet or unable to download the materials, we will have several USB drives with the tutorial materials on hand. ##\n",

    "$ get-usb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you happen to be running VirtualBox on a host Linux machine,\n",
